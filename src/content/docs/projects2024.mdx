## Calcium wave propagation in astrocyte networks.

Model a simple/2D network of astrocytes. Couple them with connexins. Try different connection patterns (ring network vs grid-like network). Under what scenarios do calcium waves propagate? You can vary:
1. The number of connexins connecting the astrocyte processes
2. The flux rate of calcium/IP3 through the connexins
3. Calcium efflux/buffering rates for the astrocytes

You can make the networks using brian2. Try and correlate the differences of calcium wave propagation through the astrocyte networks with pathologies (such as epilepsy)

## Band Pass filtering in a neuron
Record membrane voltage in response to a chirp current for a passive compartment and plot the instantaneous amplitude of the voltage against the chirp frequency. Repeat this procedure for different values of Rm and Cm. Do you see any change in the instantaneous amplitude?
Now inject sinusoidal current into the compartment and plot the phase relationship between the input current and the voltage response. Plot phase relationship for different values of Cm.
Insert HCN channel (along with the leak channel) in the compartment and repeat the chirp current and the sinusoidal current exercise, do you see any change in the instantaneous amplitude or in the phase relationship?
Change the density of HCN channel, do you see any relation between the HCN density and the instantaneous amplitude?

Simulate and check if insertion of HCN channel changes any of these measurement for a compartment:
Resting membrane potential
Input Resistance

## Local, Global coupling and interplay between two populations

Model system shown in the graph below as a rate model. 

![coupling 1](/coupling.png)

x1 and x2 are two nodes, I1and I2  are DC inputs to the nodes, W11 and W22 are the local coupling strengths  and W12 and W21 are the cross coupling strengths.
Simulate this network by trying out different values for DC inputs and coupling strengths. For what values of parameters do you get oscillation in both the nodes? Are the two nodes in the same phase? What changes the phase relationship between the population? Can you find fixed points for this system? 

Change the time constant  for both the nodes. Do you see any change in the frequency of the oscillation?

## Self-sustained activity in a random network
Large networks with conductance-based synapses can be tuned to generate self-sustained low firing rate asynchronous activity in which once a network is activated it will remain active even when external input is removed i.e. the activity generated by the network is sufficient to keep the network alive. Your task is to create such a network [Kumar et al. 2008]. (https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-9-S1-P6)
Bonus: Alain Destexhe suggested that we can improve the stability of the self-sustained activity by introducing more complex dynamics in single neurons. For instance, only a few rebound spiking neurons can improve the stability of self-sustained activity even in a small network [Destexhe 2009 J. Comp. Neurosci]. (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-009-0164-4)


## Intrinsically bursting HVC-RA

Jin et al 2007. (http://users.phys.psu.edu/~djin/PDFs/Jin-JCNS-2007.pdf) describes a model of a network of songbird HVC neurons that can generate sequences. This model relies on the idea that individual HVC-RA neurons are capable of intrinsically bursting. 
Reproduce this model.
Now, can you vary parameters in the HVC-RA neurons and see what is the regime under which these neurons burst intrinsically? 



## Response frequency of EI network

Give sinusoidal input to all neurons of a balanced EI network. Plot response amplitude vs frequency. Change the time constant of the E or I synapse to make it unbalanced, and compare the frequency tuning with the balanced case. (VanVreeswjik and Sompolinsky) Find how the resonant frequency depends on the network parameters?
Give sinusoidal input to only some of the neurons in the unbalanced network. Do the background neurons act to damp the oscillations? Does the resonant frequency of the network change?


From stripes on tigers, to spots on cheetah, patterns are ubiquitous in nature. The Turing model makes use of reaction-diffusion chemistry to generate such patterns. Here we are interested in generating a pattern with exactly 5 stripes. See if you can use turing patterns or  gradients with a threshold detection to achieve this. Any other possible mechanism, other than the diffusion controlled Turing pattern, to achieve this? Hints and references follows:
Turing pattern requires two molecules, i.e. one activator and one inhibitor (eg: https://moose.ncbs.res.in/cookbook/_modules/TuringOneDim.html). Try changing parameters such as reaction rates and diffusion constants (diffConst) etc. to achieve this.
Brooks and Bressloff, SIAM Journal of applied dynamical systems, 2016 for a different method. 

## Activity state of random networks with dynamic synapses
Networks with static synapses have been extensively studied. Much less is known about networks in which E and I neurons are connected with dynamic (facilitatory/depressing) synapses.  
Set-up a network of integrate and fire neurons (at least 4K exc and 1K inh.). We use a simple neuron model as we are interested in the effect of synapse dynamics. 
Connect the neurons randomly or in a spatial manner (your choice)
There are four types of synapses in your model. E→ E, E→ I, I→ E, I→ I. Each could be a facilitatory or depressing type. Making EE synapses facilitatory could be risky as it could destabilize the network when operated at high frequencies. What is the right combination of the synapses that keeps the network stable and also allows it to exhibit different types of dynamical states. You can start by introducing dynamic synapses in EI and IE synapses. 
Compare the states with a network in which synapses are static. Are there differences? Do we need to define new descriptors to capture the dynamics of a network in which synapses are dynamic?

## Channel densities and dendritic computation
Dendritic channels actively modulate the signal reaching the soma. Demonstrate this by varying the dendritic channel densities. 
Compare the action potential amplitude, width of AP (FWHM) in the 3 cases.
Introduce cluster of ion channels in a region of dendrite
Increase the channel density with a gradient along the dendrite
Increase the channel density globally and uniformly

## DSI and continuous attractor network

Make a continuous attractor network with neurons exhibiting spike rate adaptation. Why can’t the network stably store the memory for a long time? Implement a slow activity-dependent local disinhibition for example cannabinoid-dependent depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) to make the bump more stable. Replicate the figures produced by https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhm103




## Operant conditioning and dopamine
In operant conditioning, the animal performs random movements but only one kind of movement gives it a reward. Out of the thousands of movements how does the system know which movement gives it a reward? The reward itself comes after a few seconds in which time the animal may have made some more movements. How does the system keep track of which synapses to potentiate if the neurons themselves are stochastically firing during this waiting period? Implement a learning scheme in which the co-firing neurons get tagged due to STDP mechanism and the weight update itself occurs due to dopamine released at the time of the reward. Refer to https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhl152



## Scaling of Erdös-Rényi networks

Start with one of the non-spatial networks from the Network Dynamics tutorial. Check what happens when you increase or decrease the network size. Do you get qualitatively different network patterns?
Next, think about what happens for a single neuron in the network: for a larger network it will have more inputs. How should you scale the synaptic weights (or maybe probabilities?) in order to compensate for a larger number of inputs so that you get a similar net input level? Check if the network activity is qualitatively similar when you scale up or down the network.
Extra credit: investigate what happens for smaller networks. Does the “point network” theory break down at some point?


## Spike filtering with short-term plasticity
Short-term plasticity is responsible for facilitating/depressing synapses at very short timescales of the order of 10s of ms. It is believed to play an important role in neuronal computation by providing a form of rate-filtering mechanism.
Develop a simple short-term plasticity model like in:
Tsodyks M, Pawelzik K, Markram H. (1998). Neural networks with dynamic synapses. Neural computation
Lee et al. - A Kinetic Model Unifying Presynaptic Short-Term Facilitation and Depression. J. Comp. Neuro. - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-008-0122-6

Explore the different kinds of synapses (facilitating and depressing) by changing the parameters to get the behaviour of different kinds of synaptic connections in the brain.
How would you change the parameters to get different ranges of rate filtering (eg. 10-30Hz)? 
Look at how the filtering mechanism behaves of the stimulus is changed to a Poisson train of the same rate/frequency instead of a regular periodic stimulus
What are the limits of this system?



## Various kinds of Dendritic computations due to passive and active dendrites
Dendritic structures perform a lot more computations than previously thought. Read review by Michael London here : DOI: 10.1146/annurev.neuro.28.061604.135703
![dend](/dend.png)
Given this background, make various dendritic structures which can perform basic operations like OR, AND, NOR, XOR etc. (the more you can show the better). You can also show sequential processing like AND-OR or AND-OR-NOT-NOR etc . Also some dendritic structures act like filters and co-incident detectors (picture above). To carry out this, you can use NEURON  (completely up to you) and start with creating soma , dendritic sections from scratch and intuitively connect various apical / passive/ partially active (ex 10 % of HH mechanism) and fully active sections to perform suggested computations. You would need at least two synapses into your soma/dendritic structures to proxy for input A and B. Another resource by RG Wells. https://webpages.uidaho.edu/rwells/techdocs/Dendritic%20Computation%20in.pdf


## Frequency-dependent attenuation and charging of a dendrite
Inject sinusoidal currents of different frequencies in a passive dendrite and plot attenuation for each frequency. Fit an appropriate function to the attenuation curve and estimate  (Space constant) for each frequency. Plot the estimated space constant against the frequency. What happens to the  vs the frequency curve when you change Rm , Cm, Ra or the diameter of the dendrite. 
Inject DC current into the dendrite and record the voltage. Compare it with the charging curve of an isopotential cell (Exponential Charging). Do you see any difference? Repeat this for different values of Rm, Cm, Ra diameter. Which parameter is the difference between the dendrite charging and exponential charging increase/decrease? 
Can you estimate the membrane time constant from the dendrite’s charging curve? 

## Frequency response characteristics - Intrinsic contribution
Make a single compartment model with active conductances. Examine its frequency response characteristic (FRC)
Does the FRC depend on the amplitude of the input?
Does the FRC depends on the type of input -
Subthreshold chirp stimulus
Subthreshold EPSCs at different frequencies
Suprathreshold EPSCs at different frequencies
Change the following parameters and explore what happens to the FRC:
Input resistance
Cell capacitance
Maximal conductance of the different ion channels
Inject noise into the system, does that change the FRC?
Inject inhibitory inputs and measure if FRC is sensitive to E/I balance?

## Simple model of central pattern generators
You have already looked at one simple network of central pattern generators of STG. You can now recreate a network model of a CPG of your choice. It can be conductance based, integrate and fire neurons, Izhikevich models etc. Preferably one with at least some excitatory synapses. Use this model to answer the following: What is the source of oscillation? Is it driven by the pacemaker neuron or does it arise from the network connectivity? Are there neurons that oscillate in the absence of synaptic inputs? If yes, what parameters allow them to do so? Can you now use these to make others in the network oscillatory? If you were a neuromodulator and your goal was to change the rhythm of the network, how would you do it? Is it sufficient to change the rhythm of the pacemaker circuit or do you also have to change the synaptic weights? Below are some models you can use for reference: Tritonia swim network (Peter Getting, 1983): (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/MicroCircuitDB/showModel.cshtml?model=93326) STG network (Eve marder and colleagues): (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel?model=3511#tabs-1) (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel?model=93321#tabs-1) (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel?model=224998#tabs-1) (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15558066/)
For the more ambitious (and with better computation power), you can go one step further and see how changing the network affects movement. Below are two models for your reference: Tadpole spinal cord network: (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/ShowModel?model=267146&file=/CNS%20model%20ModelDB/README.md#tabs-1)

### Quantifying the contribution of various sources of synaptic noise to variability in postsynaptic response (lead TA: Dhruv)
Carry out stochastic simulation of action potential in the bouton  based on the geometry in _Singh et. al Nat Comm 2022._ There are several sources of variability that affect synaptic transmission.

Quantify the effect of each source of variability on the postsynaptic current response.
:::tip 
To quantify the effect of stochastic opening of voltage channel channels, increase the per calcium channel flux appropriately as you vary the channel number so that total flux remains the same. FYI: deterministic approximations are appropriate for large channel numbers.

## Noisy Repressilators

Consider the following 2-node garden variety cricuit.

![circuit 1](/rep_1.png)

$f(y)$ is some increasing function (activator) of $y$ and $g(x)$ is a decreasing (repressor) function of $x$. 

The equations governing the dynamics of this circuit are,

$$\frac{dx}{dt} = f(y) - \alpha_{1}(x)$$

$$\frac{dy}{dt} = g(x) - \alpha_{2}(y)$$

![circuit 1](/rep_2.png)
_Elowitz, Leibler, Nature 2000._

Each node represses the other. The dynamics of each node can be modelled using a 2-D non-linear dynamical system.

**Using Fitzhugh-Nagumo equations:**

Can you design X,Y,Z as bistable switches and characterize the dynamics of the network driven by noise?

Now set up X, Y, Z as an autonomous oscilaltor. How does the dynamics of the system evolve with and without noise? Characterize the variability in the frequency of periodic solutions. How can you tweak the network to minimize variability?



## AMPAR currents in the postsynaptic region of a synapse  
All glutamatergic synapses need receptors sensitive to the neurotransmitter glutamate. Sensing free glutamate is critical for inducing a postsynaptic response. Luckily,  N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)- and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type receptors are present in the postsynaptic region. AMPARs and NMDARs are glutamate-gated ion channels that locally depolarise the postsynaptic membrane after binding to glutamate. AMPARs are critical players of not just glutamate-dependent neurotransmission but also the long-term plasticity of the synapse. In this project, one will:
- model the AMPAR current in response to presynaptic stimuli.
- Model the influence of stochastic presynaptic stimulation on postsynaptic long-term plasticity.

## Energy cost of neurotransmission through a glutamatergic synapse.

Like any critical process, neurotransmission is driven by energy. Every patch of neuronal membrane spends a certain amount of energy for maintaining a resting potential and a certain amount for transmitting information. What is the cost of transmitting a certain unit of information? This project will try to answer this question. One can assume that a unit of information is represented by one action potential and that the unit of energy is one ATP. Under such assumptions, this project will model a synapse and the relevant ions/ receptors/ion channels/buffers (as shown in the figure below) to quantify the energy cost of transmitting one action potential across a synapse.
