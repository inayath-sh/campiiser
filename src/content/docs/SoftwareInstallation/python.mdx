## Installing Anaconda
Anaconda is a python distribution that includes most of the neccessary python libraries we will be using in this course. Installing anaconda is straight forward. Visit the following link to download and install the version that matches your operating system.

A step by step instruction for each operating system can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)

## Installing Visual Studio Code
We highly recommend you install visual studio code editor for all python related projects.

Once installed, vs code should automatically detect and activate anaconda. To confirm this you can check for <Badge text="(base)" variant="note" size="small" /> prefaced to the prompt in the inbuilt terminal  (<Badge text=" ctrl + `" variant="tip" size="small" />)

```bash
(base) user@pc:~$
```
:::note[Windows]
For windows you might need to select python interpreter manually. To do this, press <Badge text="ctrl + shift + p" variant="tip" size="small" /> and type `Python: Select Interpreter` and select the anaconda interpreter from the list. Restart vs code and run
```bash
conda activate
```

## Set up a conda environment

<Steps>

1. In vs code terminal create a conda environment

    ```bash
    conda create -n camp2024 python=3.11
    ```

2. Activate the environment
    ```bash
    conda activate camp2024
    ```
    The prompt should change to:
    ```bash
    (camp2024) user@pc:~$
    ```
3. Install the scientific packages
    ```bash
    conda install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas seaborn 
    ```
