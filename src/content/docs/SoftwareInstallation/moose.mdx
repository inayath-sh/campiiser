{/* # On WSL or git bash */}
{/* <Steps>


1. If not already setup, open PowerShell and install it:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```
    
2. The above will install Ubuntu. Now open the terminal on WSL/Ubuntu and install `g++` and `make`


    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install g++
    sudo apt-get install make
    sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev
    sudo apt install firefox
    ```

3. Install micromamba:

    https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/micromamba-installation.html

    ```bash
    "${SHELL}" <(curl -L micro.mamba.pm/install.sh)
    ```

    Update micromamba

    ```bash
    micromamba self-update
    ```

4. Create environment with various required packages

    ```bash
    micromamba create -n moose pip h5py numpy vpython scipy matplotlib gsl hdf5 jupyter pyqt cmake  pybind11[global] jupyterlab-vpython
    ```

    Activate the environment

    ```bash
    micromamba activate moose
    ```

5. Build and install pymoose

    ```bash
    pip install git+https://github.com/BhallaLab/moose-core.git
    ```

6. You need to do the above only once. After that, each time to use moose, open WSL Ubuntu terminal and do the following

    ```bash
    micromamba activate moose
    ```
    and you are ready to start running moose scripts.

    If the download is too heavy, we are passing around hard drives/pen drives with the docker desktop and the moose image.
