1. You'll need to prepare a contributions document outlining each member's role in the project. This should also be included at the end of your presentation. 
2. Each group will get 10 mins presentation time + 3 mins of discussion. 
3. You'll have to send your presentation before 8:00 am on 10th of July.
4. All the borrowed concepts have to be cited and referenced appropriately.
5. Each member has to present at least some part during the presentation.
